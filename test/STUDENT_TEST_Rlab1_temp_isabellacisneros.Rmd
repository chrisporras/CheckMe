##  Part 1: calculations using variables and plotting

In the following tasks you will translate mathematical models into R commands and make the computer perform calculations. The first step is to give descriptive names to these variables (instead of single letters!), and then use these variables to calculate the predictions of the models.


1. Take the model of a heart pumping with a constant rate, where V is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart over time, S is the stroke volume, $R$ is the heart rate and $t$ is time:


$$ 
V = SRt
$$ 


For a heart beating at 60 beats per minute with stroke volume of 75 ml over 80 minutes, create variables for the stroke volume, heart rate, and time (come up with your own descriptive names). Calculate the total volume pumped by the heart by turning the equation into a line of R code, assigning the result to a variable, and print out the result. ANSWER: 360000 ml

```{r}
stroke.vol <- 75
heart.rate <- 60
time.pm <- 80
volume <- stroke.vol*heart.rate*time.pm
print(volume)

# BUG: answer() funcs can't be added or removed 
# will break check()

```


2. Consider an infectious disease that spreads through a new population at an exponential rate r (per day). If there are initially I infected individuals, then after t days the model predicts the total number of infected to be T:

$$ 
T = I(1+r)^t
$$

If the initial number of infected is 20, and the rate of spread is 8% per day, calculate the total number of infected after 30 days by assigning these values to informatively named variables,  turning the equation above into a line of R code,  assigning the result to a variable, and print out the result. ANSWER: 201.2531 infected

```{r}
initial.infect <- 20
spread.rate <- 0.08
time.day <- 30
total.infect <- initial.infect*(1+spread.rate)^time.day
print(total.infect)

answer(total.infect)
```


3. The logistic model for a population P that is limited to a certain number, called carrying capacity K (population size), can be written as follows, with t time (years), r the intrinsic growth rate (per year) and A a dimensionless constant.

$$
P= \frac{K}{1 + A e^{-rt}}
$$
Let K be 30000, r be 0.08, and A be 29, assign these values to informatively named variables. Calculate the population size after 25 years by turning the equation above into a line of R code,  assigning the result to a variable, and print out the result. ANSWER: 6091.713 individuals


```{r}
carrying.capacity <- 30000
intrinsic.gr <- 0.08
a.c <- 29
time.yr <- 25
log.model.pop <- carrying.capacity/(1+(a.c*exp(-intrinsic.gr*time.yr)))
print(log.model.pop)

answer(log.model.pop)
```



## Part 2: vector calculations and plotting

1. Copy your script from part 1, question 1 and modify the line that assigns the time variable to instead assign it a vector from 0 to 1440 minutes (one for each minute); keep the same values for stroke volume and heart rate. Then your calculation for total volume should produce a vector of the same length as time. Print out the value of the vector after 3 hours (72 minutes), keeping in mind that it is the 73rd element of the vector. ANSWER: 324000 ml

```{r}
stroke.vol <- 75
heart.rate <- 60
time.pm <- 0:1440
volume <- stroke.vol*heart.rate*time.pm
print(volume[73])

answer(volume[73])
```

Plot the volume vs time using the type line with black line color and label your axes. Then change the heart rate to 120 beats per minute and re-calculate the total blood volume with the new parameter. Overlay that plot on top of the previous one using the lines() funcion with red line color. Based on the plots, describe what kind of function is this model, and what is the graphical difference between the two graphs.

```{r}
answer(plot(volume, time.pm, xlab = "total volume", ylab = "time per minute", t="l", col=1))

heart.rate <- 120
volume <- stroke.vol*heart.rate*time.pm
print(volume)

answer(lines(volume, time.pm, col=2))
```

This model is a linear function. Graphically, the graphs have different slopes. The original plot takes longer to produce the same blood volume as the newer plot.

2. Copy your script from part 1, question 2 and modify the line that assigns the time variable to instead assign it a vector from 0 to 60 days (one for each day); keep the same values for all the other variables. Then your calculation for total number of infected should produce a vector of the same length as time. Print out the value of the vector after 10 days, keeping in mind that it is the 11th element of the vector. ANSWER: 39.98009 infected

```{r}
initial.infect <- 20
spread.rate <- 0.08
time.day <- 0:60
total.infect <- initial.infect*(1+spread.rate)^time.day

print(total.infect[10]) #got the wrong answer with 11 (43.1785), but the right one with 10

answer(total.infect[10]) # CHANGED TO 11 FOR WRONG ANSWER TEST
```

```{r}
total.infect[11]
```


Plot the total infected population vs time using the type line with black line color and label your axes. Then change the infection rate to 10% and recalculate the infection numbers with the new parameter. Overlay that plot on top of the previous one using the lines() function with red line color. Based on the plots, report what are the *approximate* doubling times for the number of infectious for the two different infection rates.

```{r}
answer(plot(total.infect, time.day, xlab = "total infected population", ylab = "time (days)", t="l", col=1))

spread.rate <- 0.10
total.infect <- initial.infect*(1+spread.rate)^time.day
print(total.infect)

answer(lines(total.infect, time.day, col=2))
```

For the original plot (with spread rate 8%), the doubling rates are as follows: from 500 to 1000 infected = approx. 10 days; from 1000 to 2000 infected = approx. 9 days. For the newer plot (with spread rate 10%), the doubling rates are as follows: from 500 to 1000 infected = approx. 7 days (can't tell precisely); from 1000 to 2000 infected = approx. 6 days (again, not very precise)

3. Copy your script from part 1, question 3 and modify the line that assigns the time variable to instead assign it a vector from 0 to 100 years (one for each year); keep the same values for all the other variables. Then your calculation for the population should produce a vector of the same length as time. Print out the value of the vector after 15 years, keeping in mind that it is the 16th element of the vector. ANSWER: 3081.781 individuals

```{r}
carrying.capacity <- 30000
intrinsic.gr <- 0.08
a.c <- 29
time.yr <- 0:100
log.model.pop <- carrying.capacity/(1+(a.c*exp(-intrinsic.gr*time.yr)))
print(log.model.pop[16])

answer(log.model.pop[16])
```

Plot the population vs time using the type line with black line color and label your axes. Then change the parameter A to 2 and overlay that plot on top of the previous one using the lines() function with red line color. Report the difference between the two plots in terms of their initial values and their final values.

```{r}
answer(plot(time.yr, log.model.pop, xlab = "time (years)", ylab = "population size", t="l", col=1))

a.c <- 2
log.model.pop <- carrying.capacity/(1+(a.c*exp(-intrinsic.gr*time.yr)))
print(log.model.pop)

answer(lines(time.yr, log.model.pop, col=2))


```

For the original plot (with A = 29), the initial population value at 0 years was approximately 1000 while the final population at 100 years was approximately 30,000. For the newer plot (with A = 2), the initial population at 0 years was approximately 10,000 while the final population at 100 years was approximately 30,000.
