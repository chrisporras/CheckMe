1. Take the model of a heart pumping with a constant rate, where V is the total volume of blood pumped by the heart over time, S is the stroke volume, $R$ is the heart rate and $t$ is time:


$$ 
V = SRt
$$ 


For a heart beating at 60 beats per minute with stroke volume of 75 ml over 80 minutes, create variables for the stroke volume, heart rate, and time (come up with your own descriptive names). Calculate the total volume pumped by the heart by turning the equation into a line of R code, assigning the result to a variable, and print out the result.

```{r}
StrokeV <- 75 # in ml
HeartRate <- 60 # in bpm
Time <- 80 # in minutes
Vol <- StrokeV*HeartRate*Time
print(Vol)

answer(label="part1_question1", 
      Vol
      )
```


2. Consider an infectious disease that spreads through a new population at an exponential rate r (per day). If there are initially I infected individuals, then after t days the model predicts the total number of infected to be T:

$$ 
T = I(1+r)^t
$$

If the initial number of infected is 20, and the rate of spread is 8% per day, calculate the total number of infected after 30 days by assigning these values to informatively named variables,  turning the equation above into a line of R code,  assigning the result to a variable, and print out the result.

```{r}
Init <- 20 # initial infected
r <- 0.08 # daily infection rate
t <- 30 # number of days
Tot <- Init*(1+r)^t # total number of infected
print(Tot)

answer(label = "part1_question2",
       Tot)
```

```{r}
solution <- function(label="", ...){
  # Builds a data table from solutions
  # label gives check() target to compare with student answers
  answers <- list(...)
  for(response in answers){
    sol_df <<- rbind(sol_df, 
                       list(question = label, 
                            answer = response),
                       stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  }
}
```


```{r}
x = 1:3
y = 1:4

label = "test"

answers <- list(x,y)

for(i in answers){
  check_df <- rbind(check_df,
                    list(question = label,
                         answer = i),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}


```
